# Explore

Created in November 2017 at the hackathon organised by Barrick.

ExplOre allows local communities to report areas where they have found gold. In addition, they can set up their own gold mining business and work as a co-developers with Barrick in order to create a symbiotic relationship between Barrick and the local communities.
